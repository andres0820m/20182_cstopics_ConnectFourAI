# 20182_cstopics_ConnectFourAI
AI entity who plays connect four in real life using a camera.

project consist of an AI entity who play connect four in real life using a camera (in this case and xbox 360 kinect) to see the game board,  minimax algorithm with alpha beta to pruning and improve the time that the AI entity takes to make their decisions and stepper motor that shows were to put the puzzle when the AI plays.

The theoretical foundation used to develop this project was:
- image filtering 
- morphological transformation
- search trees
- decision treesos
- adversarial search
- minimax algorithm

## how to run:
to run the game jusr run:
python Splay.py 
this program run with and xbox 360 camera with boot drivers  freenect and openNi (see the comments to choose with one you want to use), if you wanna use a normal camera just change the frame for corresponding camera and you're free to go, also you need and arduino with and H bridge to move the stepper motor, look in to  the arduino folder for pins conections of the H bridge.
to change the turn between AI and human, you also need and photoelectric sensor (look into arduino folder for mor information about the pins connections.)
